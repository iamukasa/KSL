#MNIST for Kenyan sign language


July 2016 I met Hudson, a brilliant deaf developer who had just built an app to teach his deaf community sexual health. We became fast friends.Since then my circle of deaf friends and acquaintances only grew.
I even got a sign name.In the deaf community its easier to assign someone a sign from a unique characteristic rather than finger spelling their name every time. But there was a problem, for a long time I couldn't communicate well enough with this growing circle of deaf friends ans acquaitances,I had not learned sign language.

Conversations with Hudson and his also deaf co founder,Alfred were first interceded by the sign language interpreters they had assign
ed for meetings. His  app and sophie bot were funded under the same the program so we had a lot of those.Our conversations grew to typing texts on each of our phones notes or messaging app.I was guilty of distracting him from paying attention to his intepreter in a couple of confrences and events. Soon we developed a crude list of gestures we both understood.These are known in the deaf community as "Village sign language".
 
Interactions with the deaf community only grew  after that. May last year at Microsoft's Build conference, on a special keynote session queue on the side , a crew of deaf devs joined us and I ached to introduce myself and show off my sign name.Lucky they had an interpreter, and he helped. June last year after an event in coastal Kenya, Hudson had me tag along and gate crash  his friends beauty pageant. She was the reigning queen of the pageant and was deaf too. We all went out for drinks later but I couldnt fully participate in the conversation.All I knew was how to finger spell "GIF", my sign name and how to say "hi".
